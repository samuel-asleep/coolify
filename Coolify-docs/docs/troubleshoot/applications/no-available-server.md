# No Available Server (503) Error

If your deployed application or service shows a **"No Available Server"** error, this indicates that [Traefik](/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/overview) (the reverse proxy) cannot find any (healthy) containers to route traffic to under the provided secured URL (`https`).

## What Causes This Error?

The "No Available Server" error occurs when:

1. **Failed Health Checks** - Traefik considers your container unhealthy
2. **Domain Configuration Issues** - Incorrect domain setup or missing www/non-www variants
3. **Port Mismatches** - Exposed ports don't match your application's actual listening port
4. **Deployment Downtime** - Brief downtime during container updates
5. **Underlying Traefik Issues** - Problems with Traefik itself (e.g., Docker API version mismatch)

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Check Container Health Status

First, verify if your containers are running healthy:

```bash
# SSH into your server and check container status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

Look for containers showing `(unhealthy)` status - this indicates a health check problem.

### 2. Check Domain Configuration

Verify that you entered the domain correctly into your Application / Service configurations and your DNS records are pointing to the correct IP address. See the [Domains](/knowledge-base/domains) documentation for the full formatting rules.

### 3. Check Traefik Proxy Logs

Check the Traefik logs for underlying issues:

Through Coolify UI:

- Go to `Servers` → `[Your Server]` → `Proxy` → `Logs`

Or via SSH:

```bash
# Check proxy logs for errors
docker logs coolify-proxy --tail 50
```

Look for error messages like `client version 1.24 is too old` which indicates a [Docker API version mismatch](#solution-5-update-traefik-to-fix-docker-api-version-issue).

## Common Solutions

### Fix Failed Health Checks (Most Common)

**Symptoms:**

- Container shows as `(unhealthy)` in Docker
- Health check path returns errors
- Missing dependencies (e.g. `curl`/`wget`) in container

**Steps:**

1. **Disable Health Check Temporarily:**

   - Go to your application configuration
   - Disable the health check
   - Restart your application

   If this fixes the issue, then the problem is in your health check.

2. **Fix Health Check Issues:**

   ::: info
   These are some common solutions to fix a health check. Adjust based on your specific application and health check command. Read more about [configuring Health Checks](/knowledge-base/health-checks#configure-health-checks).
   :::

   **Missing dependencies in container:**

   Ensure that all necessary tools are installed in your Docker image for the health check to work. [Applications](/applications/index) will need either `curl` or `wget` installed.

   ```dockerfile
   # Add curl to your Dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
   # OR for Alpine images
   RUN apk add --no-cache curl
   ```

   **Wrong health check path / hostname:**

   Make sure that your app is actually serving the health check endpoint and does not return an error. In most cases, the hostname will be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

   **Port mismatch:**

   - Ensure health check port matches your app's listening port
   - If the app runs on port `3000`, health check should use port `3000`

3. **Test Health Check Manually:**

   If the above hasn't resolved the issue, manually test the health check command inside the container and evaluate the output.

   You can do this by either navigating to your container's `Terminal` tab in Coolify or by SSHing into your server and running:

   ```bash
   # SSH into your server and test a health check which uses curl
   docker exec -it <container-name> curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

### Fix Domain Configuration

#### Incorrect Domain Setup

**Symptoms:**

- Works with auto-generated domain (e.g. `sslip.io`) but not custom domain

**Steps:**
Verify that your domain is correctly set up in both Coolify and your DNS provider as per the [Domains](/knowledge-base/domains) documentation.

#### Redirect Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Redirect is set to either `Redirect to www` or `Redirect to non-www`
- Works for root domain but not www (or vice versa)

**Steps:**

1. **Add Both www and non-www Domains:**

   Make sure both, the www and non-www versions of your domain are added in the `Domains` field like so: `https://example.com,https://www.example.com`

2. **Configure Domain Redirection:**

   - Set the `Direction` to `Allow www & non-www` if you want both to work

3. **Restart Application:**
   - Always restart after domain changes

#### HTTPS Issues

If your site is only accessible via HTTP but not HTTPS, check your domain configuration:

- **For HTTPS with SSL**: Use `https://` prefix in the domain field: `https://example.com`
- **For HTTP only**: Use `http://` prefix in the domain field: `http://example.com` (no SSL certificate will be generated)

Make sure the protocol in your domain configuration matches how you want to access your site, then restart your application.

### Fix Port Configuration

**Symptoms:**

- Application / Service works via `http://IP:port` but not via domain (manual port mapping required)
- [Traefik](/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/overview) can't reach the application

**Steps:**

1. **Check exposed Port:**

   The proxy needs to know which port your application is listening on. Check that the port is configured correctly.

   <ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/troubleshoot/applications/bad-gateway/1.webp" alt="Screenshot showing No Available Server" />

   In [Applications](/applications/index), this is defined in the `Ports Exposes` field.

      <ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/troubleshoot/applications/bad-gateway/4.webp" alt="Screenshot showing No Available Server" />

   In **Service Stacks**, this is defined by either adding the port at the end of the URL in the `Domains` field (e.g. `https://example.com:3000`) or by defining the `EXPOSE` directive in your `Dockerfile`.

2. **Verify Application Listening Address:**

   <ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/troubleshoot/applications/bad-gateway/3.webp" alt="Screenshot showing No Available Server" />

   Your Application / Service might be binding to only `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, which makes it unreachable from outside the container. Ensure your app listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

### Handle Deployment Downtime

**Symptoms:**

- Brief "No Available Server" during deployments
- Happens only during container updates

**Solution: Configure Rolling Updates**

Ensure that `Rolling Updates` are correctly configured. See [Rolling Updates documentation](/knowledge-base/rolling-updates)

### Update Traefik to Fix Docker API Version Issue

**Symptoms:**

- "No Available Server" error appears
- Coolify proxy logs shows the following error message:
  ```py
  Error response from daemon: client version 1.24 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.44, please upgrade your client to a newer version
  ```
- Application container is running healthy but visiting the domain shows "No Available Server"

**Root Cause:**
The problem happened because Traefik was hard-coding Docker API versions.

::: info
The Traefik team has released a fix in **v2.11.31** and **v3.6.1**. Starting from v2.11.31 and v3.6.1, Traefik will now auto-negotiate the Docker API version, so this issue shouldn't happen again.
:::

**Solution:**

If you're already using Coolify, you'll need to update Traefik manually by follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Proxy Configuration:**

   - Go to your Coolify dashboard (https://app.coolify.io/ for cloud users) → Servers → [Your Server] → Proxy → Configuration

2. **Change Traefik Version:**

   - Change the version to: `v3.6.1` (or `v2.11.31` if staying on v2)

3. **Restart Proxy:**
   - Click `Restart Proxy`

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/troubleshoot/applications/bad-gateway/no-available-server/update-traefik-version.webp" alt="coolify proxy traefik version update" />

**Notes:**

- You need to do this on every server connected to your Coolify instance
- This applies to both self-hosted and Coolify Cloud users
  - (Cloud users: Traefik runs on **your own server** not Coolify’s so you’ll need to update it yourself by following the guide above)
- If you have changed Docker daemon configs to set Minimum supported API version, then we recommend to revert it as it could potentially cause problems in the future.

::: warning Why Coolify don't auto-update for existing servers
Some users have custom configurations (like DNS challenges) that could break when updating to a newer Traefik version. Please check the [Traefik changelog](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases) before updating.

- If you're using the default Coolify Traefik configurations, you're safe to update to v3.6.1 without any issues.
- If you're currently on Traefik v2 and don't want to upgrade to v3, you can update to the patched v2.11.31 instead.

## Advanced Debugging

### Check Traefik Configuration

```bash
# View Traefik dynamic configuration
cat /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/*.yml

# Check Traefik logs
docker logs coolify-proxy -f

# Inspect container labels to verify Traefik routing configuration
docker inspect <your-container-name> --format='{{json .Config.Labels}}' | jq
```

### Check Application Logs

```bash
# Check your application's logs for errors
docker logs <your-container-name> -f
```

### Test Health Check from Inside Container

```bash
# Execute health check command manually
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/sh
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Prevention Tips

1. **Always Use Health Checks:**

   - Implement a `/health` endpoint in your application
   - Ensure all dependencies (e.g. `curl`/`wget`) are available in your container

2. **Test Locally First:**

   - Test your health check endpoint before deploying
   - Verify port configuration matches your app

3. **Monitor Container Status:**

   - Regularly check `docker ps` for unhealthy containers
   - Set up monitoring for health check failures

4. **Use Staging Environment:**
   - Test domain configurations in staging first

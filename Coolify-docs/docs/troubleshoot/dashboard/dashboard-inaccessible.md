# Coolify Dashboard Inaccessible

Having trouble accessing your Coolify dashboard? follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue.

## 1. Determine Your Access Method

First, ask yourself: **How are you trying to access the dashboard?**

- **Custom Domain:** If you’re using the domain you set up for your Coolify dashboard, the problem might be with the Coolify proxy.
- **Direct Server IP:** If you’re using your server’s IP address, the issue could be related to your server or container status.

## 2. Test with Your Server’s IP Address

### A. Open Your Firewall Port

- **Step:** Make sure that port `8000` is open on your firewall.
- **Why:** This allows direct access to the Coolify dashboard without any proxy interference.

### B. Access the Dashboard Directly

- **Step:** Open your web browser and go to: `http://203.0.113.1:8000` _(Replace `203.0.113.1` with your actual server IP address)_
- **Observation:**
  - If you see the login page, the dashboard is working fine without proxy (skip to [step 4](#_4-addressing-proxy-related-issues)).
  - If you don't see the login page, the issue might be with your server or coolify docker containers.

## 3. Check the Coolify Container

If the dashboard isn’t accessible via the IP address, then follow these steps:

### A. Verify the Container Status

- **Step:** SSH into your server.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
  ```
- **What to Look For:**

  - Make sure the coolify containers are running and its status is healthy.

### B. Restart the Container (if necessary)

- **Step:** If the container appears to be running but you’re still having issues, try restarting it.
- **Commands:**
  ```bash
  docker restart NAME
  ```
  _(Replace `NAME` with your actual container name)_
- **Test:** After restarting, try accessing `http://203.0.113.1:8000` _(Replace `203.0.113.1` with your actual server IP address)_ again. If this doesn't work, skip to [step 5](#_5-getting-further-assistance)

### C. Conflict Coolify-Related Containers Port

Sometimes, the issue occurs if a non-Coolify container is using the same port (e.g., port 8000) as Coolify's dashboard, causing a conflict.

- **Steps:**

1. SSH into your server.
2. Stop all Docker containers gracefully:
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -q)
   ```
3. Start only the containers related to Coolify:
   ```bash
   docker start $(docker ps -a -q --filter "name=coolify")
   ```
4. Try accessing your Coolify dashboard again. The dashboard should now be accessible since conflicts on port 8000 are cleared.

- **Next:** Check your containers for the same port as your Coolify instance through the Coolify dashboard and change the port accordingly (don't forget to verify firewall rules) 

## 4. Addressing Proxy-Related Issues

If the dashboard is accessible via the server IP but not through your custom domain, then follow these steps:

### A. Start the Proxy

- **Step:** Go to the **Proxy** page in your Coolify dashboard.
- **Action:** Click the **Start Proxy** button.

- **Wait:** Give it about two minutes, then try accessing your dashboard using your custom domain.

### B. Review Recent Changes

- **Question:** Did you change any proxy configurations before the issue started?

  - **If Yes:** Reset the proxy configuration to its default settings and restart the proxy.

  - **Wait:** Give it about two minutes, then try accessing your dashboard using your custom domain.

### C. Check Proxy Logs

- **Step:** Look at the proxy logs for any error or warning messages.

- **Next:** If you see errors, they may hint at what needs to be fixed (skip to next step).
